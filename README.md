## What is this?

Beat Saber Presence is a fully customizable mod for Beat Saber which gives you Rich Presence functionality in Beat Saber.

<br/>

## How can I customize it?

Inside of the game, on the mods panel, there is a tab for BeatSaberPresence. Inside that menu, you can:

* Enable or disable the rich presence
* Enable or disable the large Beat Saber cover art
* Enable or disable the small icon denoting what you are doing
* Enable or disable the timestamp which counts up
* Make the timestamp count down in game

Inside of the BeatSaberPresence.json (Beat Saber/UserData/BeatSaberPresence.json), you can customize:

* All previously mentioned properties
* The Rich Presence inside of the Menu:
  * The top and bottom lines underneath "Beat Saber" (``MenuTopLine`` and ``MenuBottomLine``)
  * The text shown when you hover over the Beat Saber cover art (``MenuLargeImageLine``)
  * The text shown when you hover over the small icon (``MenuSmallImageLine``)
* The Rich Presence inside of the Game:
  * The top and bottom lines underneath "Beat Saber" (``GameTopLine`` and ``GameBottomLine``)
  * The text shown when you hover over the Beat Saber cover art (``GameLargeImageLine``)
  * The text shown when you hover over the small icon (``GameSmallImageLine``)
* The Rich Presence when you are Paused:
  * The top and bottom lines underneath "Beat Saber" (``PauseTopLine`` and ``PauseBottomLine``)
  * The text shown when you hover over the Beat Saber cover art (``PauseLargeImageLine``)
  * The text shown when you hover over the small icon (``PauseSmallImageLine``)

When customizing the text, you can insert snippets which replace themselves with game data.
